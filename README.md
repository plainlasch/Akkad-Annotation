# Akkad-Annotation

This program allows users to annotate images of cunei-form artifacts by single or multiple characters. These annotations can be saved and reopened with the images, conserving the transliterations digitally.

## Function Overviews

Listed here are the fundamental functionalities of the program that will be extended over time. The current program includes:
- selecting signs by drawing custom rectangles
- annotating the rectangles with custom labels or pre loaded transliterations
- labels show up in a text file adjusted to the position of the rectangle
- annotations can be converted into cunei-form signs. (Currently only Neo-Assyrian)
- Rectangles can be moved around after creation
- Rectangles can be deleted
- Save picture together with annotations

## Workflow example

1. Start by loading an image of an artifact or drawing of an artifact.
2. Draw a rectangle around the sign or signs you want to transliterate.
3. Add a label.
4. The label appears in the correct line of the text file on the right side.
5. Convert the transliteration into Cunei-Form signs.
6. save the picture inclusing the annotations.


## Future Work
To extend the functionality of the program there already planned additions. A few of these include:
- custom line annotation
- Support for Neo-Babylonian, Old-Babylonian and Hittite signs
- size-adjustable rectangles
- searchable sign dictionary by types of lines if sign in picture is not known.
- If cuneiform-sign is not know, search for suggestions by specifying the number of radicals.


## Project status
Basic program functionality present. Currently working on new features and smoother workflow...
