# Akkad-Annotation

This program allows users to annotate images of cunei-form artifacts by single or multiple characters. These annotations can be saved and reopened with the images, conserving the transliterations digitally.

## Function Overviews

Listed here are the fundamental functionalities of the program that will be extended over time. The current program includes:
- selecting signs by drawing custom rectangles
- annotating the rectangles with custom labels or pre loaded transliterations
- labels show up in a text file adjusted to the position of the rectangle

## Workflow example

1. Start by loading an image of an artifact or drawing of an artifact.
2. Draw a rectangle around the sign or signs you want to transliterate
3. Add a label
4. The label appears in the correct line of the text file on the right side.


## Future Work
To extend the functionality of the program there already planned additions. A few of these include:
- custom line annotation
- editable rectangles
- second editing step converting transcription into transliteration
- exporting all editing layers as one project file
- Support for all special signs


## Project status
currently working on basic program functionality...
